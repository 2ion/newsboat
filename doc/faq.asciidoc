== I get errors like "`color01' is not a valid color"

Numbers that start with zero are treated as octal; starting with Newsboat
2.10, these are not allowed since
https://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter/issues/186[they only add confusion].

Convert octal numbers to decimal, and drop the leading zero. For example,
`color01` should be replaced with `color1`, `color016` with `color14` etc.

== I want to have a feed that contains all unread articles of all feeds

This is supported since Newsbeuter 0.7. All you need to do is add the following
line to your +~/.newsboat/urls+ file:

	"query:Unread Articles:unread = \"yes\""

For details, refer to the link:newsboat.html#_query_feeds[documentation on
query feeds].

== After I open a link in the browser, Newsboat stays unresponsive until the browser is closed

Newsboat has to behave like that in order to accommodate users of text-based
browsers like lynx and w3m. It has to relinquish the terminal and stay out of
the way, otherwise people won't be able to see their browsers.

If you're using a GUI browser like Firefox, we recommend adding this to your
Newsboat config:

    browser "/usr/bin/env bash -c 'nohup firefox %u &>/dev/null & disown -a'"

For the curious, here's what's going on in that line:

1. `/usr/bin/env bash -c 'CMD'` executes `CMD` in BASH shell.
+
This is important, since our `CMD` uses BASH-specific `&>` and `disown`. By
default, `browser` is executed using +/bin/sh+, which only guarantees POSIX
features. Even though in practice +/bin/sh+ often points to BASH, it doesn't
always -- e.g. on Debian and Ubuntu it points to Dash;

2. `&>/dev/null` redirects stdout and stderr to +/dev/null+ -- i.e. it ignores
   all text output and all errors. This prevents `nohup` from redirecting that
   output to +nohup.out+;

3. `nohup CMD` runs `CMD` with "fake" stdin. That isolates `CMD` from the
   terminal it was started from. It _doesn't_ run the `CMD` in the background
   though;

4. `CMD &` starts the `CMD` in the background. Note that it doesn't completely
   detach `CMD` from the current shell -- it only makes it so we can run more
   commands;

5. `disown -a` detaches all the background jobs from current shell, so it stops
   caring about them.

== I get "Browser returned error code â€¦" every time I `open-in-browser`

Since 2.18 (released on 22nd of December 2019), Newsboat checks the exit code
of the browser. If the exit code is 0, meaning success, Newsboat marks item as
read; otherwise it doesn't. This gives users one more way to control Newsboat
and create streamlined workflows.

Unfortunately, this change breaks a number of configurations. This very FAQ
used to suggest setting `browser` to `firefox &`. That happened to work at the
time, but was wrong on multiple levels.

Please see <<browser-script,an answer above>> for our current recommended
solution.
