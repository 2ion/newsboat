SYNOPSIS
--------
'podbeuter' [-C configfile] [-q queuefile] [-a] [-h]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'podbeuter' is a podcast manager for text terminals. It is a helper program to
'newsbeuter' which queues podcast downloads into a file. These queued downloads
can then be download with 'newsbeuter'.


OPTIONS
-------
-h, --help::
        Display help

-C configfile, --config-file=configfile::
       Use an alternative configuration file

-q queuefile, --queue-file=queuefile::
       Use an alternative queue file

       actual logfile will only be written when you provide a logfile name.

       Use this logfile as output when logging debug messages. Please note that this

CONFIGURATION COMMANDS

XDG Base Directory Support
--------------------------

Podbeuter defaults to storing everything in '$HOME/.newsbeuter' directory. If
you prefer XDG, create '$HOME/.config/newsbeuter' and
'$HOME/.local/share/newsbeuter' directories, and Podbeuter will use them from
there on.

If you already have some files in '$HOME/.newsbeuter/', move the 'queue' file to
'$HOME/.local/share/newsbeuter/', and that should be it.

See also a corresponding section in newsbeuter(1).
