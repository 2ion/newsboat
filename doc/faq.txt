Newsboat FAQ
============

I get errors like "`color01' is not a valid color"
--------------------------------------------------

Numbers that start with zero are treated as octal; starting with newsboat
2.10, these are not allowed since
https://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter/issues/186[they only add confusion].
Simply remove leading zeros and use `color1` instead of `color01` or `color001`
and so on.

I want to have a feed that contains all unread articles of all feeds
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is supported since newsbeuter 0.7. All you need to do is add the following
line to your +~/.newsboat/urls+ file:

	"query:Unread Articles:unread = \"yes\""

For details, refer to link:newsboat.html#_query_feeds[documentation on query
feeds].

After I open a link in the browser, Newsboat stays unresponsive until the browser is closed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Newsboat has to behave like that in order to accomodate users of text-based
browsers like lynx and w3c. It has to relinquish the terminal and stay out of
the way, otherwise people won't be able to see their browsers.

If you're using a GUI browser like Firefox, you can do one of two things:

1. Start your browser beforehand. This way, Newsboat will only wait a fraction
   of a second (while new tab is being opened).

2. Wrap your browser in a script and use the script as Newsboat's browser.

Put this in `~/bin/newsboat-browser.sh`:
+
    #/bin/sh
    /usr/bin/firefox $@ &
+
Make it executable:
+
    $ chmod +x ~/bin/newsboat-browser.sh
+
Then add the following line to your Newsboat's config:
+
    browser "~/bin/newsboat-browser.sh"
